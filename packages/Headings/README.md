# Headings [![Storybook](https://github.com/storybooks/press/blob/master/badges/storybook.svg)](https://simorghstorybook.now.sh/?selectedKind=Headline)

## Description

The Headings are a set of two components, `Headline` and `Subheading`. They use a `h1` and `h2` HTML element respectively, with the `Headline` being designed for a single use on the page, with `Subheading` being aimed at repeated use.

## When to use this component

These components can be used at any point on the page, however the `Headline` is designed to be used once at the top of the page. The `Subheadline` adds an `id` value to the `h2` which can be used as an anchor when referencing content.

## Accessibility notes

The `SubHeadline` component has a tabindex of `-1` which removes the element from the default navigation flow, meaning the user can not tab to it.
